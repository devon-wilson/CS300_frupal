You wake up to a piercing sun in your eyes...
Your eyes take time to adjust to your surroundings
A warm and fresh gust of wind bellows from behind 
You glance back to realize you're near the coast
What brought you here?
Who are you?
A shining piece of paper reveals itself through the sand
But something is wrong...
The piece of paper appears in 8-bit!
It rises slowly to your face and you begin to read 

Find The Jewels 
Thats it
Thats the point of this game

It appears that you, our hero, needs to find
some jewels on this island.
Purchase tools with the gold in your pocket to 
make your way through the terrain. 
Many obstacles may get in your way so never fret 
to press 'p' to open the shop!
If you find yourself lost you might be able to 
get a hint from our jewel locater by pressing 'l'.
If you have no hope and you're out of gold and energy 
then I guess you could just press 'v' to win... 
but where's the fun in that?

Welcome to Frupal!
