# Note(Jesse): Instead of enums we may have to use something towards the end, when the user wants to create their own obstacles and obstacle tools
#              probably just going to use this for now for testing..
#              once we add the ability for the user to add more obstacles and obstacle items, we'll have to shove this into a dynamic array of sorts
#              Or perhaps not we could keep a counter starting at the size of the enum and assign the new obstacle value to that number then increment
#              the number... Probably the most interesting way, and we can generalize the case statement for the user defined method based on info
#              from the config file.
# Todo(Jesse): A method of a growing enum, or assigning obstacles a number for use in the map
# Todo/Research(Jesse): Do we want to split tiles into terrain and obstacle enums seperately?
# Usage: tiles.[the enum]
#        tiles.Terrain_grass when referenced will be just a number, 1
